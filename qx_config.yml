  # Two types of word embedding algorithm (word2vec and glove) are supported.
  # Just set the default to empty string to disable the word embeddings
  default: word2vec

datasets:
  # Support currently 3 datasets: mrpolarity, 20newsgroup and localdata
  default: localdata
  localdata:
    # Load text files with categories as subfolder names.
    # Individual samples are assumed to be files stored
    # a two levels folder structure such as the following:
    # container_folder/
    #   category_1_folder/
    #     file_1.txt file_2.txt ... file_42.txt
    #   category_2_folder/
    #     file_43.txt file_44.txt ...
    #
    # As an example, a SentenceCorpus dataset from
    # https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentence+Classification
    # has been used. The dataset includes following 3 domains:
    # arxiv, jdm and plos
